    Qlue-UI
</h1>

**Qlue-UI** is a modern WebUI for **SPARQL**, driven by [Qlue-ls](https://github.com/IoannisNezis/Qlue-ls).
It does not target a single, but **many** SPARQL engines.
It’s small, shiny, and ready to help you explore your RDF data effortlessly.

> [!WARNING]
> **Work in progress — expect breaking changes.**
>
> This project is the next generation of **Qlever-UI**, but the migration from
> the legacy version is still ongoing. The API, configuration format, and
> internal structure may change significantly between releases.
>
> The project will be considered stable and final once it reaches **version 1.0**.
> Until then, use at your own risk.

See the [feature overview](docs/features/index.md) for the full tour.

## Availability

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The container image was renamed.** It is now published as
> `ghcr.io/qlever-dev/qlue-ui`; the old `ghcr.io/qlever-dev/qlever-ui-new`
> package receives no further builds. Update the `image:` line in your
> `docker-compose.yaml` (or your `docker pull` / `docker run` command) to the
> new name — no configuration or data changes are needed.

Prebuilt container images are available from the
[GitHub container registry](https://github.com/qlever-dev/qlue-ui/pkgs/container/qlue-ui).

The `edge` tag is always the latest version.


```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/qlever-dev/qlue-ui:edge
```

The images may be used directly:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 7000:7000 ghcr.io/qlever-dev/qlue-ui:edge
```

The Qlue-UI is now available under <http://localhost:7000>, configured to
query the Wikidata SPARQL endpoint.  The `Examples` tab provides several
queries to explore.

## Quick Start

```bash
docker compose up
```
Qlue-UI is now available under <http://localhost>.

## Development Setup

For local development, run the frontend and backend separately:

```bash
# backend (FastAPI, managed with uv) — port 8000
cd backend
uv sync
uv run fastapi dev src/api/main.py

# frontend (Vite) — port 5173
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

On first start the backend seeds `backend/config.yaml` and
`backend/examples/` from the defaults shipped inside the package, in
`backend/src/api/defaults/`.
Both local paths are git-ignored, so endpoints and examples you add while
developing stay out of commits. To change what ships by default, edit the
files under `backend/src/api/defaults/`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Upgrading an existing checkout.** `backend/config.yaml` and
> `backend/examples/` used to be tracked by git, so a `git pull` across this
> change fails with *"Your local changes would be overwritten"* if you have
> edited them. Stashing does not help — git detects the rename and silently
> applies your endpoints to the shipped defaults instead. Back the files up
> outside git, restore the tracked copies, then pull and put yours back:
>
> ```bash
> BK=$(mktemp -d)
> cp -r backend/config.yaml backend/examples "$BK"/
> git restore backend/config.yaml backend/examples
> git clean -qfd backend/examples
> git pull
> rm -rf backend/examples
> cp "$BK"/config.yaml backend/config.yaml
> cp -r "$BK"/examples backend/examples
> ```
>
> Seeding skips paths that already exist, so your config and examples are
> left untouched from then on.
